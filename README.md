Theme 4: Algorithm to Code Generation with Gen AI Agent
The working of the web app can be seen as a video here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Aess_ttNFUrjBJSHWzgruJ7Ro6Apayoo/view?usp=sharing)
It contains a interface to enter user defined algorithm in natural human language and there is a section to upload image and ask query related to that algorithm
It supports voice to text feature as well , where the voice to text feature gets activated when you utter the word( laptop ) and start describing the algorithm 
The minimum time taken to generate the code is 4 seconds and the maximum time is 10 seconds
You could also ask the time complixety , memory , I/O of the algorithm or ask it to suggest better ones!
It has a drag and drop blocks where children can build code in Javascript by draging and droping te blocks!
It also has a ready to use code of common algorithms and in 3 language with a card interface

Description:We have Developed a Gen AI agent capable of converting prompted algorithms into compiled code. 
The tool should take user-defined algorithms and generate executable code in the desired programming language.

We have added a simple user interface with background video 



Key Features:
• Input interface for algorithm description
The input supports text and all image formats whereupon you can ask question based on the image you have!It support all programming languages in the world

• Translation of algorithms into multiple programming languages
The algorithm can be translated in any programming language

• Code compilation and error checking
There is section for compiling and checking for error of the generated code to easily analyze if the geenrated code is correct or not

• Output of ready-to-use code snippets
You can copy the code and use it in your projects

Requirements:
Google gemini Access token ( Free to use can be taken from google studio) and be placed in (api_key="Your token here") in all flask pages

Languages used:
Python
Html
Css
Javascript
