Theme 4: Algorithm to Code Generation with Gen AI Agent
The working of the web app can be seen as a video here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Aess_ttNFUrjBJSHWzgruJ7Ro6Apayoo/view?usp=sharing)
It contains a interface to enter user defined algorithm in natural human language and there is a section to upload image and ask query related to that algorithm
It supports voice to text feature as well , where the voice to text feature gets activated when you utter the word( laptop ) and start describing the algorithm 
The minimum time taken to generate the code is 4 seconds and the maximum time is 10 seconds
You could also ask the time complixety , memory , I/O of the algorithm or ask it to suggest better ones!
It has a drag and drop blocks where children can build code in Javascript by draging and droping te blocks!
It also has a ready to use code of common algorithms and in 3 language with a card interface

Description:
AlgoCodeAI is a web application powered by a Gen AI agent capable of converting user-provided algorithms into executable code. With a user-friendly interface, this tool translates algorithms described in natural language into various programming languages. It also supports voice-to-text input, image-based queries, and offers features for code generation, error checking, and performance analysis.

The application aims to streamline the algorithm-to-code process, enabling users to generate code effortlessly, analyze performance metrics (like time complexity and memory usage), and learn programming through interactive, drag-and-drop blocks.



Key Features:

Natural Language Algorithm Input:
Enter your algorithm in plain text and have it converted into code.

Voice-to-Text: 
The web app supports voice input, activated by saying the word "laptop." This allows users to describe the algorithm verbally.

Image-Based Query:
Upload images (like flowcharts or diagrams) and ask questions related to the algorithm depicted in the image.

Multi-Language Support: 
Translate your algorithm into any programming language such as Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, etc.

Instant Code Generation: 
The system generates executable code within 4-10 seconds.

Code Compilation and Error Checking:
The web app compiles the generated code, checks for errors, and provides insights into its correctness.

Ready-to-Use Code Snippets: 
Copy and integrate the generated code into your projects directly from the app.

Performance Metrics: 
Query and analyze time complexity, memory consumption, and I/O operations of your algorithm.

Drag-and-Drop Blocks for Beginners: 
For beginners, especially children, there is a drag-and-drop interface to build code using blocks in JavaScript.

Sleek and Intuitive Interface: 
The app features a modern, clean design with a background video for enhanced user engagement.

System Requirements :

To use this web app, you will need a Google Gemini API access token. This free token can be obtained from Google Studio and must be placed in the api_key="Your token here" field in all Flask pages.
